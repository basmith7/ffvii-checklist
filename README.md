# Final Fantasy VII Checklist

To view the checklist [click here](https://basmith7.github.io/ffvii-checklist/).

This checklist was created by adopting the source code from the [Dark Souls 2 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet/tree/gh-pages) created by [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb).

The walkthrough is thanks to [DeathGodGarra's NPC Side Quests Guide V2](https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/168566-dark-souls-iii/73599466).

I just put together a checklist for help with new players and veterans alike to help not miss anything. The content is mostly from [Bartelmy's Walkthrough](http://ryuninadeis.blogspot.com/2015/02/final-fantasy-vii-spoiler-free-item.html), and the code is from [ZKjellberg's Dark Souls 3 Cheat Sheet] (https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet.)
